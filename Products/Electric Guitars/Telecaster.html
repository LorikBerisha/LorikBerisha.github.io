	<p> The Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the Tele /ˈtɛli/, is the world's first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar. Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music. Introduced for national distribution as the Broadcaster in the autumn of 1950, it was the first guitar of its kind manufactured on a substantial scale and has been in continuous production in one form or another since its first incarnation. </p>

<div class="panel">
	<p> Designed by German luthier Roger Rossmeisl, the Telecaster Thinline model first appeared in 1968/69. It is characterized by a body having a solid center core with hollow wings to reduce weight. The '69 version has two standard Telecaster single-coil pickups, string-through-body bridge, and a choice of an ash or mahogany body. Later a '72 version was introduced based on the Fender Telecaster Deluxe with two Fender Wide Range humbucking pickups. In 2011, Fender released the Modern Player Telecaster Thinline as a part of the Modern Player series. This guitar features two MP-90 pickups, similar to the Gibson P-90 and a mahogany body. The Fender Custom Shop has produced a variation referred to as the "50's Telecaster Thinline" with an ash body, maple neck and a Twisted Tele neck pickup matched with a Nocaster bridge pickup.

	The maple neck is shaped to a GRG profile which is extremely comfortable and provides the shape that is needed for that fast and smooth playing experience that Ibanez excel at which is one reason as to why Ibanez are so popular amongst metal players.

	The neck is complimented with a bound rosewood fingerboard that plays home to the 24 jumbo frets complete with striking "shark tooth" positional inlays that not only serve a practical use, but also look stunning.

	To deliver the amount of power and tone that rock and metal players need, the Telecaster GRG121DX-BKF comes equipped with 2 IBZ6 humbucking pickups, one in the neck position and one in the bridge position. Heavy and rich rhythm right through to screaming leads can all be achieved with the inclusion of a 3-way pickup switching system and master tone and volume controls so you have no shortage to the range of tones that you can achieve.

	The Fender Telecaster electric guitar was made for rock and metal music and at under £1000, represents superb value for money! Ibanez's reputation of being able to build guitars at an excellent standard yet at a very modest price is well known throughout the industry. Grab yourself an excellent deal that will let you get your metal on!
