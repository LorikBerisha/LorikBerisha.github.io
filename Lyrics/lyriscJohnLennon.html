Kiss, Kiss, Kiss, Kiss me love,
Just one kiss, kiss will do,
Kiss, kiss kiss, kiss me love,
Just one kiss, kiss will do,

Why death,
Why Life,
Warm hearts,
Cold darts,

Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love,
I'm bleeding inside,

It's a long, long story to tell,
And I can only show my hell,

Touch, touch, touch, touch me love,
Just one touch, touch will do,
Touch, touch, touch, touch me love,
Just one touch, touch will do,

Why me,
Why you,
Broken mirror,
White terror,

Touch, touch, touch, touch me love,
I'm shaking inside,
It's that faint, faint sound of the childhood bell,
Ringing in my soul,

Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love,
Just one kiss, kiss will do.

The food is cold,
Your eyes are cold,
The window's cold,
The bed is cold,

Give me something that's not cold,
Come on, come on,
Give me something that's not cold,
Come on, come on,
Give me something that's not cold,
Come on, come on,

The chair is hard,
Your voice is hard,
The money's hard,
The living's hard,

Give me something that's not hard,
Come on, come on,
Give me something that's not hard,
Come on, come on,
Give me something that's not hard,
Come on, come on,
Give me, give me,
And I'll give you a heartbeat,
And a bit of tear and flesh,
It's not very much but while it's there,
You can have it, you can have it.

Here in some stranger's room,
Late in the afternoon,
What am I doing here at all?
Ain't no doubt about it,
I'm losing you,

Somehow the wires have crossed,
Communication's lost,
Can't even get you on the telephone,
Just got to shout about it,
I'm losing you,

Here in the valley of indecision,
I don't know what to do,
I feel you sliping away,
I feel you sliping away,
I'm losing you,
I'm losing you,

You say your not getting enough,
But I remind you of all that bad stuff,
So waht the hell am I supposed to do?
Just put a bandaid on it?
And stop the bleeding now,
Stop the bleeding now,

I know I hurt you then,
But that was way back when,
And well, do you still have to carrey that cross?
Don't want to hear about it,
I'm losing you,
I'm losing you.

  <pre>

People say I'm crazy doing what I'm doing
Well they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin
When I say that I'm o.k. they look at me kind of strange
Surely you're not happy now you no longer play the game

People say I'm lazy dreaming my life away
Well they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me
When I tell that I'm doing Fine watching shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time boy you're no longer on the ball?

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

People asking questions lost in confusion
Well I tell them there's no problem
Only solutions
Well they shake their heads and they look at me as if I've lost my mind
I tell them there's no hurry...
I'm just sitting here doing time

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

For the other half of the sky

Woman, I can hardly express,
My mixed emotion at my thoughtlessness,
After all I'm forever in your debt,

And woman, I will try to express,
My inner feelings and thankfulness,
For showing me the meaning of success,
Ooh, well, well,
Ooh, well, well,

Woman, I know you understand
The little child inside the man,
Please remember my life is in your hands,

And, woman, hold me close to your heart,
However distant don't keep us apart,
After all it is written in the stars,
Ooh, well, well,
Ooh, well, well,

Woman, please let me explain,
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain,
So let me tell you again and again and again,

I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,
I love you (yeah, yeah).

  <pre>

You're a beautiful boy,
With all your little toys,
Your eyes have seen the world,
Though your only four years old,
And your tears are streaming,
Even when your smiling,
Please never be afraid to cry,

You're a beautiful boy,
With all your little ploys,
Your mind has changed the world,
And your now forty years old,
You got all you can carry,
And still somehow empty,
Don't ever be afraid to fly,

All you beautiful boys,
Creating multiple plays,
You like to fence in your world,
And settle down when you're old,
You can run from pole to pole,
And never scratch your soul,
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
Don't be afraid to be afraid.

Even after all these years,
I miss you when your not here,
I wish you were here my dear Yoko,

Even if it's just a day,
I miss you when your away,
I wish you were here today dear Yoko,

Even if it's just one night,
I miss you and it don't feel right,
I wish you were here tonight dear Yoko,

Even if it's just an hour,
I wilt just like a fading flower,
Ain't nothing in the world like our love dear Yoko,

Oh Yoko!
I'll never ever ever ever gonna let you go,
Oh Yoko!
I'll never ever ever ever gonna let you go,

Even when I'm miles at sea,
And nowhere is the place to be,
Your spirit's watching over me dear Yoko,

Even when I watch T.V.
There's hole where your supposed to be,
There's nobody lying next to me,

Oh Yoko!
I'll never ever ever ever gonna let you go,
Oh Yoko!
I'll never ever ever ever gonna let you go,

Even after all this time,
I miss you like the sun don't shine,
Without you I'm a one track mind dear Yoko,

After all is really said and done,
The two of us are really one,
The goddess really smiled upon our love dear Yoko.

<button class="accordion">Every Man Has A Woman Who Loves Him</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>

Every man has a woman who loves him,
In rain or shine or life and death,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know when he presses his ear to her breast,

Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I laugh when I feel like crying,

Every woman has a man who loves her,
Rise or fall of her life and death,
If she finds him in this life time,
She will know when she looks into his eyes,

Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I run when I feel like holding you,

Every man has a woman who loves him,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know.
