Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

Saying it's true
It's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams

And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the change you want to
Be what you want to be

When you get a head
A head full of dreams
Into life I just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open handed
When you got me lost for words

I sing, oh-ohohoh
Oh-ohohoh
Oh-ohohoh [repeats]

A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams

Into life I just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Been standing in the corner
Studying the lights
The dreaming of escape
Will keep you up at night

But someone had put the flare up
Got me in rays
So... I guess I better stay

"Uh uh, no come on!" you say

It's a fools gold thunder
It's just warning rain
Don't let the fears just start, what if
I won't see you again
Around here you never want to
Sleep all night

So start falling in love,
Start the riot
And come on rage with me

We don't need words
We'll be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing
But geography

Come on and raise it
Come on raise this noise
For the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on, it's not over!
If you mean it say loud
Come on, all for love
Out from the underground

Away with me
We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
We'll be birds
Flying free
Holding on in the mystery

Fearless through this you said
We'll go
Through this together (ooohh)
When you fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool

[Beyoncé:]
Drink from me, drink from me
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Symphony
Then we'll shoot across the sky
We're on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
Then we'll shoot across the sky

[Coldplay:]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Coldplay &amp; Beyoncé:]
And said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Coldplay:]
I, oh, I, oh
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
I, oh, I, oh, I, oh
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Woo!

[Coldplay &amp; Beyoncé:]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

[Coldplay &amp; Beyoncé:]
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Coldplay:]
I, oh I, oh I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Beyoncé &amp; Coldplay:]
I, oh I, oh I
La la la la la la la
So high, so high
I, oh I, oh I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Beyoncé:]
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky

Oh they say people come
They say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran
A goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled
In perfect purple
So how come things move on
How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world?
When I should but I can't let you go?

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling within me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night
We'd be friends 'til we died
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me
And the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
'Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told me

Turn your magic on,

Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on,
Not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on,

We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape

If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh, then I

[Coldplay:]
I know it's over before she says
I know it falls at the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits
For a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

[Coldplay:]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin
Oh, come on don't give up
Don't see me give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh, didn't we have fun?

[Coldplay &amp; Tove Lo:]
I know it's over before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
"I know it's over," Icarus says
To the sun
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight 'til it's over,
Fight 'til it's done

[Coldplay &amp; Tove Lo:]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Now we're stopping the world, stopping in its tracks
But nothing's too broken to find a way back
Before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

[Coldplay &amp; Tove Lo:]
'Cause you and me
We were always meant to... always meant to be
We were always meant to... always meant to
You and me
We were always meant to... always meant to be

Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh, didn't we have fun?

Maybe we could again

Been around the world, looking for someone like you
Pyramids try, Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I never say die, aim never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world, universe too
Been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Tanzaku stars, Lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you
Right when the storm comes through

'Cause I never say die, aim never untrue
Never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fight for you, yeah!

'Cause you reign, all 'cause you reign

We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine saying,
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design."

And time seemed to say,
"Forget the world and its weight."
And here I just want to stay

Amazing day
Amazing day

We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place
Where you can be what you are

And the view, the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms I just want to sway

Amazing day

Can the Birds in poetry, chime?
Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick on your orange field
Up and up
Up and up

See a pearl form a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood
It's in your blood

Underneath the storm, an umbrella is saying,
"Sitting with the poison takes away the pain."
Up and up
Up and up, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up
Up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart, oh

Yes, I wanna grow, yes, I wanna feel
Yes, I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up, oh

Try and see the forest, there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love
Just need love

When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

But you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say, "It's mine," and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

[2x]
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

Up and up and up

Oh

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up

Believe in love
