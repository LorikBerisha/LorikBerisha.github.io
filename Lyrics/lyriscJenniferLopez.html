[CHORUS:]
If you had my love 
And I gave you all my trust 
Would you comfort me 
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue 
Would you lie to me 
And call me baby 
Now if I gave you me, this is how it's got to be 
First of all I won't take you cheatin' on me 
Tell me who can I trust if I can't trust in you 
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool 
You said that we could possibly spend eternity 
See that's what you told me (that's what you said) 
But if you want me 
You have to be fulfilling all my dreams 
(If you really want me babe) 

[CHORUS]

Said you want my love and you've got to have it all 
But first there are some things you need to know 
If you want to live 
With all I have to give 
I need to feel true love 
Or it's got to end, yeah 
I don't want you 
Trying to get with me 
And I end up unhappy 
(Don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain) 
So before I do 
Give myself to you 
I have to know the truth 
(If I spend my life with you)

I've been so 
Caught up in the thought of me and you 
Even though I love 
Someone else I know my heart belongs to you 
Tell me how did we 
Ever let the situation get this far 
Maybe we should just 
Try to hide the things we feel inside 
Things I know we can't deny 

[CHORUS:]
Should've never told you 
That I cared about you 
Didn't think that it would be, so bad 
Should've never kissed you 
Should've never held your hand 

Got to find a way to let these feelings go 
What did I 
Do the day I let you slip into my soul 
It was then, when I 
Realized that I would always want you in my life 
No one else can know 
Of the things that we've been saying on the telephone 
It would be so bad 
If they ever knew that me and you 
Were secretly into each other 

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
I'm so scared, trembling inside 
'Cause I'm feeling like somebody else already knows 
Oh my God, I love you both so much 
And to have to choose between the two 
Is hurting me so deep inside 

[CHORUS:]
Should've never told you That I cared about you 
Never thought that it would be, so bad, hum 
Should've never kissed you 
Should've never held your hand 
I don't ever want to feel this way again

First you say that you have to go away 
I never should have been with you anyway 
Now you say you want to stay 
It's too late, 'cause I'm sending you on your way 
You say that you have to go away 
I never really loved you anyway 
Now you say you want to stay 
It's too late, it's too late 

Like a puppet on a string 
You came and took control of me 
Would've given anything 
To be your one and only 
Filled my head with fantasies 
Of what one day you'd give to me 
Full of hope for what could be 
(I sat and waited patiently) 

[CHORUS]

For a time you were for me 
Everything that I could need 
Gave me time and diamond rings 
But something else was missing 
You never stayed the whole night through 
I suffered, prayed and cried for you 
After all that we've been through 
I feel I never even knew you 

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
There's no need to call me on the phone 
I don't wanna hear from you no more 
No need, don't call 
Don't be a fool and stand outside my door 
'Cause being the woman that I am 
I got to go on with other plans

When I opened up my eyes today 
Felt the sun shining on my face 
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way 
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see 
Got rid of fears that were holding me 
My endless possibilities 
Has the whole world opened for me 
That's why I'm feeling... 

[CHORUS:]
I'm feeling so good 
I knew I would 
Been taking care of myself 
Like I should 
'Cause not one thing 
Can bring me down 
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round... 

Now the day is turning into night 
And everything is still going right 
There's no way you can stop me this time 
Or break this spirit of mine 
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine 
Anything I want will be mine 
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time 
Call a few friends of mine 
'Cause I'm loving life 
And tonight's for feeling...

Turn the music up, let's do it 
C'mon people let's get loud 
Let's get loud 
Turn the music up to hear that sound 
Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya 
What you gotta do 

If you wanna live your life 
Live it all the way and don't you waste it 
Every feelin' every beat 
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 
Life's a party, make it hot 
Dance don't ever stop, whatever rhythm 
Every minute, every day 
Take them all the way you gotta live 'em ('cause I'm going to live my life)
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say

Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Turn the music up to hear that sound 
Let's get loud, let's get loud 
Ain't nobody gotta tell you

Life is meant to be big fun 
You're not hurtin' anyone 
Nobody loses 
Let the music make you free
Be what you wanna be 
Make no excuses 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
To gotta prove it 
You gotta mean what you say 
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way 
You gotta prove it

If you only knew 
What I've been going through 
Waiting and wanting you 
Could this be love 
How, tell me how will I know 
Will my heart make me believe it so 
Or can I trust the way I feel 
If you could read my mind 
You see how hard I've tried 
Still I can't decide 

[CHORUS:]
If you only knew 
What I've been going through 
Waiting and wanting you 
Could this be love 
Oh, tell me could this be love 

[SOLO:]
Do you know if it's true 
That real love lasts a lifetime 
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky 
And do you know if you can fall for 
Just a moment 
Is a moment for all time 
Why, why am I so unsure 
Is that love knocking at my door 
Or the sound of my beating heart 
If you could read my mind 
You know I just can't hide 
What I feel inside

Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

[CHORUS:]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now, leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[CHORUS 2x]

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
