I've been around the world
I've known a lot of girls
Livin' and lovin'
It's hard to keep them all in line
I've seen a lot of sights
Many crazy nights
Cruisin' and boozin'
It's a wonder that I'm still alive

Never wasted any time
Never missed a beat
Total satisfaction
Always guaranteed

Tease me
Please me
No one needs to know
Tease me
Please me
Before I have to go

Spead the world around
The boys are back in town
Reelin' and rockin'
We're rollin' with it win or lose
The girls are dressed to kill
Lookin' for a thrill
Slidin' and glidin'
Sometimes they make it hard to choose

I never wasted any time
Never missed a beat
Total satisfaction
Always guaranteed

Tease me
Please me
No one needs to know
Tease me
Please me
Before I have to go
Tease me
Please me
We'll take it nice and slow
Tease me
Please me
Just let the feeling grow

Out for a thrill
Got time to kill
Just livin' up my dreams
for heaven's sake
She's on the make
A twisted vicar's queen
And then one night we took a ride
She was all over me
Outrageous
Just ain't real
I was too wasted to see

Before you get in too deep
And you get burned by the heat
Oh yeah
She'll take you there
You know it happened to me

She'll make your heart break
She'll give you fever
She'll tell you everything but don't believe her
A perfect stranger
She knows the game
She'll promise heaven on earth
But don't believe her

Out on the street of broken dreams
Where no one ever wins
Just when you thought you'd made a start
You're back where you begin

Before you get in too deep
And you get burned by the heat
Oh yeah
She'll take you there
I think you know what I mean

She'll make you crazy
She's such a teaser
Says you're the only one but don't believe her
She deals in danger
The girl's insane
She'll promise heaven on earth
But don't believe her

Before you get in too deep
And you get burned by the heat
Oh yeah
She'll take you there
You know it happened to me

Don't believe her (Don't believe her)
Don't believe her (Don't believe her)
Don't believe her (Don't believe her)
I can't believe her (Don't believe her)

She'll make your heart break
She'll give you fever
She'll tell you everything but don't believe her
A perfect stranger
She knows the game
She'll promise heaven on earth

She'll make you crazy
She's such a teaser
Says you're the only one but don't believe her
She deals in danger
The girl's insane
She'll promise heaven on earth

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change

Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change

The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change

Blackout in London
Just slip'n slide
Blackout in London
I'm just about to lose my mind
Big time in Paris
Time's gonna fly
Big time in Paris
It's c'est la vie for me tonight

Here I go
To take the one and only road I know
In my life
Here I go
Another place to bare my heart and soul
Restless nights

Hot shot in Dallas
A wild horse to ride
Hot shot in Dallas
I don't know how but I survived
Rock hard in Rio
Pure sex and crime
Rock hard in Rio
It's just too much to take tonight

Here I go
To take the one and only road I know
In my life
Here I go
Another place to bare my heart and soul
Restless nights

Restless nights
Restless nights

Red hot in Moscow
Turn back the tide
Red hot in Moscow
The eagle rocks the bear tonight
Die hard in Tokyo
Lexington nights
Die hard in Tokyo
I barely made it out alive

Here I go
To take the one and only road I know
In my life
Here I go
Another place to bare my heart and soul
Restless nights

<button class="accordion">Kicks After Six</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>
Another morning, such as ordinary day
She's doin' time from nine to five
The hours waste away
There's no escape, She's a part of the bog machine
She's a slave to the suit and tie
Seven days a week

But every night
She can hardly wait
It feels alright
To give it all away

Good girls get their kicks after six
Good girls get their kicks after six
(She needs it bad, real real bad)
She wants what she never had
All the things that make a good girl bad
She gets her kicks after six

Some days its hard to face the cruel reality
Just waitin' for the bell to ring
She wants to be free
It feels so good to start another endless night
She spreads her wings for another flight
She's running wild

But every night
She can hardly wait
It feels alright
To give it all away

Good girls get their kicks after six
(She needs it bad, real real bad)
Good girls get their kicks after six
(Ooh yeah shake it for me baby)
She wants what she never had
All the things that make a good girl bad
She gets her kicks after six

Good girls get their kicks after six
(She needs it bad, real real bad)
Good girls get their kicks after six
(Ooh yeah nothin's gonna stop her)
She wants what she never had
All the things that make a good girl bad
She gets her kicks after six

Good girls get their kicks after six
(She needs it bad, real real bad)
Good girls get their kicks after six
(C'mon baby take it to the limit)
She wants what she never had
All the things that make a good girl bad
She gets her kicks after six

Late at night when you're all alone
Take a ride to the danger zone
If someone wants to cut you down to size
You never argue with a loaded .45

Just when you've had enough
It's really getting tough

I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Someone get me out of here alive
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Can't you see I'm much too young to die

You can feel the tension in the street
There's no escape, getting closer to the heat
You play with fire, get your fingers burned
It's too late, past the point of no return

Just when you've had enough
It's really getting tough

I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Someone get me out of here alive
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Can't you see I'm much too young to die

You know nothing about loving
You lost somewhere down the line
You know nothing about giving
You should draw the line

You keep looking out for something
Something you're never gonna find
When will, will you show your feelings
You will lose your mind

Who's to blame my love
You play a dangerous game
Who's to blame my love
All you want is money and fame

You play, play with emotions
You need, need a stepping stone
You're out, out for sensations
Don't you, don't you feel alone

I get up in the morning
For my dose of the news
Crawl right back in the sack girl
Had enough of the truth
Spend your dollars and rubels
Buy a piece of the wall
Build it up in your backyard
I'm so sick of it all

Ooh, it's a crazy world
Ooh, it's a crazy world

Drivin' down to the city
Doin' 155
Better late than never
I'm more dead than alive
We can find the Titanic
Put a man on the moon
But we can't fix out backyard
Man we better start soon

Ooh, it's a crazy world
Ooh, it's a crazy world
Ooh, it's a crazy world
Ooh, it's a crazy world

I don't want to hear about it
I wish it would be worlds away
You know the more I think about it
The more I feel we need to change
I get up (In a crazy, crazy world)
We all live (In a crazy, crazy world)
Ooh yeah (It's a crazy, crazy world)
I gotta get out (Of this crazy, crazy world)

Goin' home to my baby
It's been another hard day
Bust my balls for the tax man
So what else can I say
They spent our money on missiles
For the third world war
Now they're stacked in my backyard
We don't need them no more

Ooh, it's a crazy world
Ooh, it's a crazy world

The wise man said just walk this way
To the dawn of the light
The wind will blow into your face
As the years pass you by

Hear this voice from deep inside
It's the call of your heart
Close your eyes and you will find
The passage out of the dark

Here I am
Will you send me an angel?
Here I am
In the land of the morning star

The wise man said just find your place
In the eye of the storm
Seek the roses along the way
Just beware of the thorns

Here I am
Will you send me an angel?
Here I am
In the land of the morning star

The wise man said just raise your hand
And reach out for the spell
Find the door to the promised land
Just believe in yourself

Hear this voice from deep inside
It's the call of your heart
Close your eyes and you will find
The way out of the dark

[4x]
Here I am
Will you send me an angel?
Here I am
In the land of the morning star
