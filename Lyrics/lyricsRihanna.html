Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is my pleasure
Cause nothing could measure

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more

[Chorus x2:]
Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me

[Drake]
I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know word of mouth
The square root of 69 is 8 some, right
'Cause I've been tryna work it out, oooow
Good weed, white wine
I come alive in the night time
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Oh, let it play, say you gotta leave
But I know you wanna stay
You're just waiting on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name
Wear it out, it's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go the text that I write is gonna say

[Rihanna]
Not everybody knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
Boy, you stay up on it
You got that something that keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge, let's explore your talent

[Chorus 2x:]
Hey boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you 'cause you just my type
Oh na na na na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put you work up
Oh, oh

Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
Oh na na, what's my name?
What's my name, what's my name?

[Rihanna]
Baby, you got me, ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth you rock me
So I surrender to every word you whisper
Every door you enter, I will let you in

[Chorus]

You're so amazing, you took the time to figure me out
That's why you take me, way past the point of turning me on
You about to break me, I swear you got me losing my mind

Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?

Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
What's my name, what's my name?

Drifting
Settling
Off to
A foreign place
If I can't see
What's in front of me
It's a mystery
Well then apparently

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, begone, bye bye, so long
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Put a sock in it
Just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up
I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
Cause I'm so fed up
You got me messed up
If we hooking back up
Don't press your luck today, today

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So, how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So, how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us

In this California king bed

We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

Yeah yeah yeah

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king
My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me

Can't get it off my mind

Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum

I Call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm ‘bout to leave town (yeah)

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up 'Cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh why

Sometimes I get you
Sometimes I don't understand
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes it's you I can't stand
Sometimes I wanna hug you
Sometimes I wanna push you away
Most times I wanna kiss you
Other times punch you in the face
'Cause every minute you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say I'm through with you
Take my heart from you
And you come running after me and baby I'm back with you

Oh, you're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone
I, will throw my hands up 'Cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh why

Sometimes I catch you
Sometimes you get away
Sometimes I read you
Other times I'm like where are you on the page
Sometimes I feel like we will be together forever
But you're so complicated
My heart knows better

Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone
I, will throw my hands up 'Cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Oh why

I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone

Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone
I, will throw my hands up 'Cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Oh why

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

[Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don’t know why I’m still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you’ll always be my hero
Even though you’ve lost your mind

[Chorus:]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

[Rihanna]
Now there’s gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you’ll always win
Even when I’m right
‘Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it’s sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]

[Rihanna]
So maybe I’m a masochist
I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are goin’ up
In smoke with all our memories

[Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
That we’ll have each other’s backs, ’cause we’re that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let’s not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who’s countin’?
I may have hit you three times, I’m startin’ to lose count
But together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refuse counsellin’
This house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I’m in my fuckin’ mind, without you I’m out it

[Chorus]

I love the way you lie [3x]
