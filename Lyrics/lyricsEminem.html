[Intro]
Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
So on a bigger stage they came to see you spit your game
Ooooohhhhhhh
It shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
Fuck em' all, tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again

So, god damn... is it that time again already
Haha, you don't look too happy to see me
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck ya'll then

[Verse 1]
You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog fall back you mutts
Fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy
And my nuts, licked, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Bitch you don't fucking think I know that you suck dick dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny!
Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shitting and pissing on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So buck the Buddha, light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, c'mon

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Ya'll are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker
I'll show you pussy footin, I'll kick a bitch in the cunt
'Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
Man chill, nah I can't god damnit
Rap is a landfill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you're fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, 'til then I drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women
When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don't know, I don't know what caused, I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know but I probably be this way 'til my dying day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me

[Intro:]
Ayo Before I start this song man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

[Chorus: Kobe]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
I guess I keep talkin to myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one who's crazy?

Yeayah
Woah wah
Woah wah (oh oh oh oh oh)
Woah wah
Woah wah (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)

[Bridge: Eminem]
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there
Who feels the way I feel
If there is, let me hear just so I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went away I guess to open up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew that I was going through growin' pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins
On the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissin Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself
He was spittin and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
Thank God that I didn't do it
I would've had my ass handed to me
And I knew it but Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin another pill tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You gon' start dissin people for no reason?
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying
Your health is declining with your self-esteem, you're crying out for help

[Chorus: Kobe]

[Bridge: Eminem]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle
Maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talkin to the wall though
I don't see nobody else (I guess I keep talkin to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I've put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not a egomaniac that's not his motto
He's not a desperado he's desperate, it's starting to bottle inside 'em
One foot on the brake one on the throttle
Fallin asleep with writers block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
Admit you got a problem you brain is clouded you pouted long enough
It isn't them it's you you fuckin baby
Quit worrying about what they do and do shady
I'm fucking going crazy

[Chorus: Kobe]

[Bridge: Eminem]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I pick myself off the ground and fuckin swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice suffice this time around
It's different them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing em out
I've come to make it up to you no more fucking around
I've got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I've let em down
So please accept my apology I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin up, pullin up, blowin up, all over
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie, Weezy keep ya head up,
T.I., keep ya head up, Kanye, keep ya head up,
Don't let up, keep slayin em
Rest in Peace to DJ AM
Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day

[Chorus: Kobe]

[Bridge: Eminem]

[Talking: Eminem]
So there it is (there it is)
Damn
It feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just... forgot who the fuck I was man
Ay yo
And to anybody who thought about going there, it was never nothing personal, some shit I was going through
And to everybody else...
I'm back! (I'm back) haha

Yeah.. Ya Know?.. Critics Man
Critics Never Got Nothin Nice To Say man
You know the one thing I notice about critics man?
Is.. critics never ask me how my day went
Well imma tell em

[Verse 1:]
Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter, hot headed as ghostrider
Cold hearted as spiderman throwin a spider in the snow
So ya better get lower than Flo-Rida inside of a lowrider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes
Listen dog Christmas is off this is as soft as it gets
This isnt golf this is a blisterin' assault
Those are your wounds this is the salt
So get lost
Shit dissin me is just like pissin off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws and
Cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then discribe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make chris piss in his draws
Ticklin him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

[Hook:]
You on fire
Thats how ya know your on a roll
Cause when you hot its like your burnin up everyone elses cold
Your on fire
Man I'm so fuckin sick I got ambulances pullin me over and shit
Your on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop the blow
Your on fire.. your on fire

[Verse 2:]
I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses if you mistook the for a song, look
This aint a song its a warnin to brooke, hogan and david cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writin and kill it
Im lightning in a skillet your a fuckin flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin a fan
Mr mathers is the man
Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Salivas like sufiric acid in your hand itll eat through anything metal the ass of iron man
Turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin chance is assanine
Yeah ask the nine man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it I aint playin
Pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin a sign sayin
Vietnam vet.. I'm out my fuckin mind man
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you this aint savage you aint never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldnt make a belemic puke on a piece of fuckin corn and peanut poop
Sayin you sick quit playin you prick dont nobody care
Then why the fuck am I yellin at air
I aint even talkin to noone cause aint nobody there
Nobody will fuckin test me cause these hos wont even dare
Im wastin punchlines but I got so many to spare I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw dont waste it save it psycho yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about michaels hair

[Hook:]
You're on fire
Thats how ya know your on a roll
Cause when you hot its like your burnin up everyone elses cold
Your on fire
Man I'm so hot my motherfuckin firetrucks on fire homie
Your on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to give the whole hip hop shop the blow

[Chorus - Pink:]
You can sound the alarm
you can call out your guards
you can fence in your yard
you can hold all the cards
but I won't back down
oh no I wont back down

[Verse 1 - Eminem:]
Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe Devilles
brain dead rims yeah stupid wheels
girl I'm too for real
lose your tooth and nails
try to fight it, try to deny it
stupid you will feel
what I do, I do it well
shooting from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill
half a breath left on my death bed
screaming, "F that!" yeah super ill
baby what the deal
we can chill, split half a pill and a happy meal
fuck a steak slut
I cut my toes off and step on the receipt before I foot the bill
listen garden tool don't make me introduce you to my power tool
you know the fucking drill
how you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?
summer's eve Massengill
shady's got the mass appeal baby crank the shit
cause it's your Goddamn jam
you say that you want your punchlines a little more compact
well shawty I'm that man
these other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said
settle ya fucking ass down I'm ready for combat, man
get it calm Batman?
nah, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as nuts
lines are like mom's cat scans
cause they fucking go bananas
honey I applaud that ass
swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
ma, show ‘em how it's done
spazz like a God Damn Tas, yeah

[Chorus - Pink]

[Verse 2 - Eminem:]
Girl, shake that ass like a Donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J Fox in the drawers playin' with a etch-a-sketch
bet you that you'll never guess who's knocking at your door
people hit the floors
yeah tonight ladies you gon get divorced
girl forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with
Chris's force like you pissed him off
talented with the tongue motherfucker
you ain't gotta lick in yours
hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
makin' cash registers shit their draws
think you spit the rawest
I'm an uncooked slab of beef
laying on your kitchen floor
in other words I'm off the meat rack
bring the beat back
bring me two extension chords
I'mma measure my dick shit I need 6 inches more
fuck my dicks big bitch
need I remind you that I don't need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig?
you're addicted I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here
need a fix up I'm the big shot
get it dicks snots
you're just small boats little pricks
girl you think that other prick's hot
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
‘fore I sit back and let ‘em get hot
better call the cops on ‘em quick fast
shady's right back on your bitch ass
white trash with a half a six pack in his hatchback
trailer hitch attached to the back (dispatch)

[Chorus - Pink]

[Verse 3 - Eminem:]
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping?
does a bird chirp? Lil' Wayne slurps syrup til he burps
and smokes purp
does a word search gets circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself
of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
or you're the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
psych I'm spiking you like a football
been this way since I've stood a foot tall
you're a good catch with a shitty spouse
got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
gimme good brain
watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain
bitch, you listening? Tryna' turn me down
slut, I'm talking to you, turn me back up
are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'
I'ma shit stain on the underwear of life
what's the saying? where there's thunder there's lightning
and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
then how the fuck have I been hit six times
in three different locations
on four separate occasions?
and you can bet your stinking ass
that I've come to smash everything in my path
fork was in the road took the psychopath
poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
so hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone
shake your booty shawty I'm the shit
why you think Proof used to call me Doody?

[Chorus - Pink]

[Intro]
Yeah! Oh! Get Up! I said get up! Let's go!
Better watch out, now
Here we come (come)
And we ain't stoppin' until
We see the mornin' sun (sun)
So give us room to do our thing
Cause we ain't come to hurt no one (one)
So everybody come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone (one)

[Verse 1]
Now first of all I'm the boss
I just wanna get that across
Man even my Dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows
Spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here come on get him
If you dames want 'em
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him?
Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now could I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Now, get in, dance!

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
It ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

[Verse 2]
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow I probably still be too high to get outta bed
Til I feel like I been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin' "Die Santa!"
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you balling
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
Cause as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west, but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
C'mon

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

[Verse 3]
Now whether you're black, white or purple
If you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck
You ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood
Now honey, don't let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
Cause girl I got a sick wip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and
Make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece 'a dry pita
I'll be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground
And flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell ya now
I'm so raw I still need to un-thaw
You feel me, yall?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Cold slaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up!

[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

[Ozzy]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Eminem]
Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for delf like Philly,
feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complaining,
But life keeps on complicating, and I'm debating,
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls
Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it,
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty,
When inside I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help.
can't do it myself, too weak, two weeks I've been having ups and downs,
going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,
round with the idea of ending the shit right here.
I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors,
I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear is Hailie,
I'm afraid if I close my eyes and I might see her,
Shit...

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon,
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you.
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills,
And you falling off with yer skills, and your own fans are laughin' at you?
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up,
Be a man, stand, a real man would've had this shit handled.
(I) know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust,
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first,
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse,
Now I'm popping Vic's, Perks and Methadone pills.
"Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it"
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men,
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it,
It's in their best interest to protect their investment.
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then...

[Chorus]

(don't know what I'm gonna do, but I just keep on going through changes)

My friends can't understand this new me,
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be,
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse to be at a all time low.
I sit alone in my home theater watchin' the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour he was still alive.
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleepin' pills will make me feel alright.
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night,
I'll just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right,
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dole 'em out
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice,
Yeah baby hold me down.

[Chorus]

(don't know what I'm gonna do, but I just keep on going through changes)

[Eminem]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through.
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof.
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through?
I think about the things I would have never got to say to you,
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do.
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina, too,
I still love your mother, that'll never change,
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day.
There are just too many things to explain, when it rains,
guess it pours, yes, it does, wish there wasn't any pain.
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame,
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows I've never been a saint.
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history,
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say,
"I miss you" subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way.
But I just had to get away, don't know why,
I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm...

[Chorus]

(don't know what I'm gonna do, but I just keep on going through changes)

<button class="accordion">Not Afraid</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>

[Chorus:]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

[Intro (during Chorus):]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something I do it,
I don't give a damn what you think,
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album
He's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]

Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was ehhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
Cause I ain't playing around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

[Chorus]

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now! (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
I feel amazing and I'm...

[Chorus]
