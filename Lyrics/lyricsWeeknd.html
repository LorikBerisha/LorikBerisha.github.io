I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yeah
Main bitch out of your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

House so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean up with her face, man
I love my baby
You talking money need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me I don't see the shade
Switch up my style I take any lane
I switch up my cup I kill any pain

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that roadster SV, ah
Pockets over weight getting hefty, ah
Coming for the king that's a far cry
I come alive in the fall time I
No competition I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

House so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces

Let a nigga Brad Pitt legend of the fall
Took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek groove in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
Hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love we just pray for cars

House so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean up with her face
Man I love my baby
You talking money need a hearing aid
You talking bout me I don't see your shade
Switch up my style I take any lane

[The Weeknd:]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm great
Know its been a while, now I'm mixing up the drank
I just need a girl who gon' really understand
I just need a girl who gon' really understand
I'm good, I'm good, I'm great
Know its been a while, now I'm mixing up the drank
I just need a girl who gon' really understand
I just need a girl who gon' really understand

And I seen her get richer on the pole
I've seen her, I knew she had to know
I've seen her take down that tequila
Down by the liter, I knew I had to meet her
Ooh, she mine, ooh girl, bump and grind
Ooh, she mine, ooh girl, bump a line
Angelina, lips like Angelina
Like Selena, ass shaped like Selena

I'm like, got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name

I'm good, I'm good, I'm great
Know its been a while, now I'm mixing up the drank
I just need a girl who gon' really understand
I just need a girl who gon' really understand

I've been poppin' just took three in a row
I'm down to do it again, I'm on a roll
I've seen him outside tryna reach her
You tryna leave him, you said I'm the reason
Tell me lies, ooh girl, tell me lies
Say you're mine, I'm yours for the night
I'm the realest, she said I'm the realest
Head be genius, dick game be the meanest

I'm like, got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name

Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains

Bathroom stalls for the powder nose (she loves)
High heel shoes with the open toes (she loves)
She's got a good time wrapped in gold (she loves)
For you, for you
All red dress with the devil eyes (she loves)
So obsessed with the camera lights (she loves)
You love her, but you can't deny (she loves)
The truth, the truth

She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
It's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm

False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)

Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide (she loves)
Dollar, dollar bill is her only type (she loves)
You love her but you'll never be (she loves)
The one, for one
Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy (she loves)
She chase hearts with the Hennessy (she loves)
You love her, but you'll never be (she loves)
Enough, enough

She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
She's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm

False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)

False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

She always leaves the man she loves
But the diamonds are forever
She always seems to be alone
But the diamonds make it better

False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let her go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face-numbing off a bag a blow

I'm like goddamn bitch I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn bitch I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these RnB niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick she go low mane

You know me, you know me, you know me
Everytime you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'm a keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG

All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out, hotel bedsprings we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you cause

You know me, you know me
You know me, you know me
Everytime you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

Why don't you shake something, shake something
For the Don, don't you break nothing, break nothing
Big girl won't you work something, work something
For the Don, don't you hurt nothing, hurt nothing
Big girl won't you shake something, shake something
For the Don, won't you break nothing, break nothing

[The Weeknd:]
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Daniel Wilson:]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit in headache
I reminisce my life innocence
Or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint
With light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us are probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (head)
Head, head, more head (head)
Oh God, bless the dead (yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna cop more land
I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

[The Weeknd:]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Daniel Wilson:]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on
