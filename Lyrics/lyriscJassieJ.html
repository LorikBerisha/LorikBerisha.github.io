Still alive and I'm going hard
Make my mark and I'm breaking all records
You know me, I'm a superstar

Walking through the fire, Please don't let me go.
Take me to the river, I need you to know
I'm burnin' up, come put me out, come and put me out
I'm burning up, come put me out, come and put me out

Hot in the kitchen like a thousand degrees, that's how I'm feeling when you're next to me
I got a fever, tell me what did you do?
Temperature rising when I look at you, look at you

Subliminal, sex
Drippin' in, sweat
I'm losing my, breath

Look what I've found
It's 'bout to go down
I want it right now

Walking through the fire, Please don't let me go.
Take me to the river, I need you to know
I'm burnin' up, come put me out, come and put me out
I'm burnin' up, come put me out, come and put me out
I'm burnin' up, come put me out, come and put me out
I'm burnin' up, come put me out, come and put me out

I've got the matches, you've got the gasoline
Light up the floor like it's Billie Jean
The way we're moving, by the end of the song
They're gonna have to pull the fire, f-fire alarm

Subliminal, sex
Drippin' in, sweat
I'm losing my breath

Look what I've found
It's 'bout to go down
I want it right now

Walking through the fire (walking through the fire)
Please, don't let me go (please, don't let me go)
Take me to the river (take me to the river)
I need you to know (I need you, I need you to know)

[2 Chainz:]
2 Chainz!
Everything hot like it's fresh off the grill
Million dollar grill look fresh on the hill
Plus I'm 6'5", she need to step in some heels
'Fore she step up in here you need to step up your gear
Wish a Lamborghini had four doors (four doors)
From the corner store to the corridor (corridor)
Me and my homie on the dance floor
White girl in the middle, looking like an Oreo
(I'm burnin' up)
2, 4, 5 we can burn up
Turn down for what, nigga turn up
Motherfucker must ain't learn nothin'
Back in the day used to down with a burn coat
(I'm burnin' up)
Light got the Lord on the top floor
In a Ford, wearin' Tom Ford
Walk in the club and her ass start clappin'
Tell shawty I want an encore

Come put me out, come and put me out
I'm burning up, come put me out, come and put me out
Come put me out, come and put me out (I'm burning up)
Come put me out, come and put me out

I'm burning up, come put me out, come and put me out
I'm burning up, come put me out, come and put me out
I'm burning up, come put me out, come and put me out
I'm burning up, come put me out, come and put me out

Faded but I still start
When I saw you on my way out
I rolled all my sleeves up
You may be a situation

Say you want my heart, it's a silly thing to start
I can tell you know what it takes to make me fall apart

So here we are, it's going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
'Cause, boy, you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talking about, a teachers' pet,
Baby you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet talk me all night, honey pie

So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)

No I'm not a liar
Just don't know how to tell you the truth
All we need is time
We don't know why we do what we do

But we do, but we do
Yeah we do, what we do
Yeah we do, what we do
Yeah we do, what we do

So much pressure
Why so loud?
If you don't like my sound
You can turn it down

I got a road
And I walk it alone

Uphill battle
I look good when I climb
I'm ferocious, precocious
I get braggadocious

I'm not gonna stop
I like the view from the top (yeah)

You talk that blah blah, that la la, that rah rah sh*t
And I'm so done, I'm so over it
Sometimes I mess up, I f*$% up, I hit and miss
But I'm OK, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't colour inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greats
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me

Oh, oh
Oh, ah

Oh, ah

Those who mind don't matter
Those who matter, don't mind
If you don't catch what I'm throwing
Then I'll leave you behind

Gone in a flash
And I ain't living like that

They talk that blah blah, that la la, that rah rah sh*t
Roll with the punches, and take the hits
