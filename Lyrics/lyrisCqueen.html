A word in your ear, from father to son
hear the words that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

And the voice is so clear, time after time it leeps
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see, your country to be
Just keep on building on the ground that's been won

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Take this letter that I give you,
Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die
A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you, will stay by your side
Through the years till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will -
But the air you breathe I live to give you

Father to son
Father to, father to, father to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white queen walks and
The night grows pale
Stars of lovingmess in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have i stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still i wait

My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that i wait

Dear friend goodbye
No tear in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began

You never heard my song before the music was too loud
But now i think you hear me well for now we both know how
No star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear
But some day, one day...

Funny how the pages turn and hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you and you shall be a queen
Today the cloud it hangs over us and all is grey
But some day, one day...

When i was you and you were me and we were very young
Together took us nearly there the rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs over us and we're alone
But some day, one day...
We'll come home

<button class="accordion">The Loser In The End</button>

  <pre>
Mama's gotta problem
She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy just left home today
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend

She washed and fed, and clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is "goodbye ma"
And the nightimes for her tears
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's ma on whom you can always depend

So listen mothers everywhere
To just one mother's son
You'll get forgotten on the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets, and just remember
It's so long since you were young

You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll choose their new shoes that's not far to bend
You're ma on whom they can always depend

<button class="accordion">Ogre Battle</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination - that is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of his hand is incredible
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
"Keep a look out"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind you and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

Ogre-men are going home
And the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, the trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle

<button class="accordion">The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>
He's a fairy feller
The fairy folk have gathered round the new moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut at nights noon time
To swing his ace he swears, as it climbs he dares
To deliver...
The master-stroke

Ploughman, "waggoner will", and types
Politician with senatorial pope - he's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown, dirty fellow
What a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter - he's my hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow "can we see the master-stroke"
What a quaere fellow

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees

<button class="accordion">Nevermore</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>
There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore
Can't you see
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see
Why did you have to leave me
Why did you deceive me
You send me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Nevermore
Nevermore

<button class="accordion">The March Of The Black Queen</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>

Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you and where do you go?

You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it—
And the world will so allow it
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkies praying in the dead of night

Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes

A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings, you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love

I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power—
Now do the march of the black queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be your bad boy - I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils, and she bakes, and she never dots her Is

Forget your sing-alongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone forever
