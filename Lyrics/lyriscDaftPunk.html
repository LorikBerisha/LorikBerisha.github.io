When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I started really to play the guitar.
I definitely wanted to become a musician.
It was almost impossible because it was, the dream was so big that
I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town.

I was studying and when I finally broke away from school and became musician.
I thought "Well, I may have a bit of a chance."
Because all I ever wanted to do is music but not only play music but compose music.

At that time, in Germany, in 1969-70, they had already discotheques
So I would take my car and go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about 7-8 songs.
I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two years to survive.
In the beginning, I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s, the sounds of the 60s, of the 70s, and then have a sound of the future.

And I said, "Wait a second, I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer, which is the sound of the future?"
And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click so we put a click on the 24 track which then was synced to the moog modular.
I knew that it could be a sound of the future but I didn't realize how much impact it would be.

My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio

Once you want to free your mind about a concept of harmony and music being correct, you can do whatever you want.
So nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do

<button class="accordion">Octopus's Garden</button>

  <pre>
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

There are so many things that I don't understand

I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

And I say it's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here 

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

<button class="accordion">Instant Crush</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>
I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take

One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him—his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
But no one gives us any time anymore

He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

[Pre-chorus]
"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine."
I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend

Some more again

[Verse 2]
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore

[Pre-chorus]
"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine."
I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door...

I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We're swimming around,
It's all I do, when I'm with you

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

Touch, I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see

A tourist in a dream
A visitor it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss, suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?

A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Home
Hold on
If love is the answer you're home [8x]

Touch, sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real

I need something more
I need something more
