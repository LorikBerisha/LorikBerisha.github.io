[Verse 1 - Justin Timberlake:]
You take the clothes off my back
And I let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Oh
(Thanks for warning me [x2])
You curse my name
In spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much
(Thanks for warning me [x2])
Yeah

[Hook:]
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from your cup
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Verse 2 - Jay-Z:]
(Uh) Blue told me to remind you niggas (uh)
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' about
I'm the nigga (uh), caught up in all these lights and cameras (uh)
But look what that shit did to Hammer (uh)
God damn it I like it
Bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all that money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice
That's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself

[Bridge - Justin Timberlake:]
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
Now we all just entertainers

[Hook - Justin Timberlake]

[Verse 3 - Jay-Z:]
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough
I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high
Sitting low
Sliding by
In that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt
But this chain works
I think back
You asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with
It, this shit ain't work
This light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours
Why you mad
Take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with that bath water
You're still alive
Still that nigga
Nigga you survived
You still getting bigger nigga
Living the life
Vanilla wafers
In a villa
Illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson's, Thriller

[Hook - Justin Timberlake]

[Bridge]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart just so you can watch me bleed it
And I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
(Thanks for warning me)
Yeah
(Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much, yeah.
(Thanks for warning me [x2])

[Hook]

Don't know why...

[Verse 1]
I just want a Picasso, in my casa
No, my castle
I'm a hassa, no I'm an asshole
I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle
I wanna Rothko, no I wanna brothel
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million, in a dirty hotel
With the fan on the ceiling, all for the love of drug dealing
Marble Floors, gold Ceilings
Oh what a feeling - fuck it I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma

[Hook]
Oh what a feeling
Picasso Baby, Ca Picasso baby
Ca ca ca Picasso Baby, Ca ca ca Picasso baby
Oh what a feeling [x2]

[Verse 2]
It ain't hard to tell
I'm the new Jean Michel
Surrounded by Warhols
My whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes
See me thrown at the Met
Vogue'ing on these niggas
Champagne on my breath, Yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
Because I be going ape at the auction
Oh what a feeling
Aw fuck it I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version
With better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go ahead lean on that shit Blue
You own it

[break]

[Verse 3]
I never stuck my cock in the fox's box but
Damned if I didn't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man
On CNN and Fox
My Miranda don't stand a chance, with cops
Even my old fans like old man just stop
I could if I would but I can't
I'm hot, and you blow
I'm still the man to watch, Hublot
On my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth
The cameras pops niggas is cool with it
Till the canons pop
Now my hand on the bible
On the stand got your man in a jam, again
Got my hands in cuffs
I'm like god damn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin
Piece skin rupture spleens
Cracks rips go through cribs and other things
No sympathy for the king huh
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me
Come through with 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO
Though I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gonna to take
For me to go
For y'all to see
I'm the modern day Pablo
Picasso baby

Just let me great, just let me great
I feel like mothafuckin' Cassius Clay right now, Genius!
Don't be good my nigga, be great
After that government cheese, we eating steak
After the projects, now we on estates
I'm from the bottom, I know y'all can relate

[Hook]
Fuck up the world
Let's fuck up this world
Fuck up the world
Me and destiny got a date

[Verse 1]
Martin had a dream, Hov gotta team
My chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush, Confetti on my fur
Turn right on Red Hook, niggas heavy on the curve
See most of my niggas died early twenties or late teens
I'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1% of a billion more then niggas even seen
Still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing, clean

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came thru Pasadena in the low low
Just to show respect to the chulos
Feel like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want my shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murder Malcolm, gave Cassius the shakes
Wait, tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know I'm gon shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Send a light to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy, basking on top

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sipping D'USSE boy this ain't your daddy yak
He in a Cadillac; me? I'm in the Maybach
This ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got stripclubs feeling like Oxford, I swear
Teacher teacher, I trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game, those the Spike Lees
You front row every where, you in the H.O.V's
Jordan 1's and dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way I'm feeling
We have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top
Cause the bars don't struggle and the struggle don't stop

You can turn up your nose high society
Never gone turn down the homie
Knock knock I'm at your neighbor house
Straight cash I bought ya neighbor out
You should come to the housewarming
Come and see what your new neighbor 'bout
Yellow Lambo in the driveway
A buck 35 on the highway
Frank Sinatra on my Sonos
Loud as fuck I did it my way
A million sold before the album dropped
White Lexus before I had a deal
Ask Bun B about me
This ain't no snap back, a nigga's been trill
By the way, fuck your math
You ain't gotta count it my nigga I can add
1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 20 million
Oh, I'm so good at math

Have you ever been to heaven? Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bow down to your highness? And do you know how heaven taste?
Lie me down

[Verse 1]
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head - this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding - we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter - help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in the streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2, how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw fuck it you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo Yellow shit
Color of Jello-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and

[Hook: 2x]

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion

[Verse 2]
Getting ghost in the Ghost
Can you see me?
Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angels wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division
Like my Maybach partition n
God is my chauffeur

Boy they loves Hova
From the south side of Chi
To Brooklyn where I growed up I confess
God in the flesh
Live among the serpents
Turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael recycle, these are not 16s
These are verses from bible
Tell the preacher he's a preacher
I'm a motherfucking prophet, smoke a tree of knowledge
Drink from a gold chalice, you gotta love it
I arrive at pearly gates, I had luggage
Meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers
