They say sing what you know
But I've sung what they want
Some folks do what they're told
But baby this time I won't
Will look through that door
I know the truth won't lie
Some things I've done before I can't justify

There are kings in my past
Things no one can be proud of
But I stand in the light I've casted
And turn away from any lack of love
Oh, and I walked through that door
I say here I go
You see me and nothing more
I'm singing what I know

I know better
I know better

Legend is just a name
I know better than to be so proud
I won't drink in all this fame
I'll take more love than I'm allowed

I won't have to cut it off from where it came
My history has brought me to this place
This power and the color of my face

And I know better, oh
I know better, oh

I'll rise from the floor if I don't win
I'll bust open that door so let me in
And the music chooses me to sing I let her
I'll sing what I know, yes

I know better, oh
I know better, yes
I know better
I know better

[John Legend:]
All this trouble in this here town
All this shit going down
When will they focus, on this
Streets ride up with the TV crews
Look ma, we on the news
But they didn't notice
Before this
They float above the city lights
Forget the truth inhale the lies
Just enjoy the show
They see us reaching for the sky
Just ignore them to survive

Maybe we should go
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Penthouse floor

All that bubbly all that wine
Oh man look at the times
Didn't they notice, notice
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this

Once you're above the city lights
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own
The holding on is made for us
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home

Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
Can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)

[Chance The Rapper:]
I heard this old joke once, it was like uh knock knock, who's there, it's us, who's us?
Just us, who dis? Just playin'
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era
I'm in the penthouse baby
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs
Held back, I had to grab crab legs
And then there were only but a few
Conversations held with patience, what a party what a view
What a dress, what a song
What a beautiful time
My folks still downstairs waiting in line
They never been in these rooms
They never stayed with these folks
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes
So was I fly in my suit, in a group, on the cover
Forcing a smile, then he tells me another
He said what happened to the boy that climbed in the trunk
He pushed me off the top he said "Jump nigga jump!"

[John Legend:]
Oh don't bring me down I need a room in the clouds
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate
Oh my favourite mix
A little ignorance and bliss
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse

Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
We'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Those penthouse doors
We'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Baby, I'm in the penthouse floor
Baby, let's ride the elevator
Til we can rise some more
Go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go let's go let's go)

[John Legend:]
Fire and the ice colliding, I wanna go deep and dive in
It's heaven on Earth but hell of a night to melt into one
She's never been afraid of sirens, head down but keep drivin'
Damn we might crash moving so fast but baby

[John Legend and Brittany Howard:]
Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh

[Brittany Howard:]
Darkness and light, streaming, the end of our life beginning
No longer alone, my will become gone, we melt into one
Both hands on the floor, you go low
Who was I before? I don't know
And who am I now? Your body shows how
The past just has no meaning

[John Legend and Brittany Howard:]
Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh

Oh, don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it

[John Legend:]
Yeah we used to flirt with freedom 'fore everybody knew our name
We became their favorite secret, love for love and not for fame
Oh, when I was your user, your FaceTime abuser, dose after dose 'til we crashed
Now they bet on our game, say well go down in flames, it's too good but we never could last

[John Legend and Miguel:]
But, oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
But, oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload, love, love...
Don't we always make a show of love, love, love, love, yeah...

[Miguel:]
Let that cellphone ring, let that bluebird sing, let that message say unread
Let them talk about us, let them talk too much while we rule the whole world from our bed

[John Legend and Miguel:]
'Cause, oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
Oh, chained our life together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?

Pulling me further
Further than I've been before
Making me stronger
Shaking me right to the core, oh
I don't know what's in the stars
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
But I know what's in my heart
If you ain't mine I'll be torn apart

I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over

Something inside us
Knows there's nothing guaranteed, yeah
Girl, I don't need you
To tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could
To turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard
For that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have

Can you just stay through the night
Turn out the bed in the blinds
Before your turn around
Can you just stay through the night
Let me breathe you in until gravity
And we fall through the hole in the light
Make this our kingdom
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divide

I may not know a lot of things but I feel it in my chest
Know I won't let the blue flame die
We can't lose hope just yet
'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
We're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but I know that we're surefire
Know that we're surefire

Can't keep this bed warm on the left side
When something is cold is a goodbye
Why won't you turn around
Ignore all that shit from the outside
The world is a nightmare
Wake up and stay here
Let me be on your side
We'll make this our kingdom
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divide

And oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting
Let go giving, let go and give up

I may not know a lot of things but I feel it in my chest
Know I won't let the blue flame die
We can't lose hope just yet

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting
Let go giving, let go and give up

I may not know a lot of things but I feel it in my chest
If we just let the blue flame die the devil wins this bet

Know that we're surefire

Will you live like me, in a world run by desire?
Will you wake from worldly dream and not be tired?
Will you work like me to lift the conversation higher?
Will you be cool like water putting out the fire?
How can you be free from all this sorrow?
Will the ones you love today be gone tomorrow?

And if angels don't have answers to your prayers
Oh, I will be there, oh I will be there

And if who you love don't want your love, well then...
Do you cut a deal with love and run again?
You see, love contains the meaning of despair
Will you think like me? Will you have your mother's fire?
Maybe the way we are will not be how you're wired
Will we do right by you? Will we you have what you require
To make your days on this Earth not so dire?

Can you choose to lead if no one follows?
And if we fell today, must you tomorrow?
Sanctify your answer not your prayer
Oh, I will be there, yeah, I will be there
Yeah, I will be there

And even when it all becomes too much
When you're growing old and feeling out of touch
Listen to this song and just take care
And know that I will be there, yeah, I will be there
No, I swear that I will, yeah, I promise I will

Better late than you don't get there, do the math
Oh you oughta be grateful

Why's it hard for a man to be satisfied?
Oh, I got one glimpse of the green grass on the other side
'Cause it's all been comin' to this and goddamn I won't be denied

For takin' over my daydreams?
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue
Oh I wanna blame it on you

Did I know my weakness?
Did I mount all my defenses?
Did I tell you to leave me alone?
How can I blame you?
You saw somethin' inside of me break
You saw me wanna make a mistake

How can I blame you?
You saw somethin' inside of me break
You saw me wanna make a mistake
How can I blame you
For takin' over my daydreams?
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue
Oh I wanna blame it on you
I wanna blame it on you
I wanna blame it on you, yeah

Nobody's buying
There ain't any truth to it
The fact is you're lying
But I'm getting used to it
Promising we'll stay together
Down in your heart, you know better
I know what I lost before it's gone

Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Same old story
Over and over again
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Over and over again

Oh, say I'm overreacting
As if you believe in that
But you answer questions
That nobody even asked
Although we may stay together
Down in your heart, you know better
You pictured all the ways that you'll move on

But you just tell me slowly
Over and over again
Same old story
Over and over again
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Over and over again

I will try to pull the wool over my eyes
You thought it would keep me warm
You said it was cold outside

Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Same old stories
Over and over again
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Oh, over and over again

Oh, say it again, yeah
Keep on, yeah
Over and over

What can you buy with the ultimate sacrifice
If you don't believe in the afterlife?
Oh I still grieve rememberin' what you were like
Now what good is a dream when the dreamer dies?

Some are better than good
Greater than great
Some are misunderstood
And they get told to wait by

All of the greatest
Greatest of all
Were chasing their fading star
Who'll be the latest
The latest to fall?
We're marching into the dark

What if your like was just in the day to day
And after you're gone the world stays the same?
Why should you love what you're gonna lose anyway?
Oh I've imagined one hundred ways

Some are just no good
Some will let it just fade
Some are misunderstood
We'll just have to wait, 'cause

All of the greatest
Greatest of all
Were chasing their fading star
Who'll be the latest
The latest to fall?
We're marching into the dark

Oh Heaven knows where we are
Chasing the fading stars
Heaven knows where we are
Motioning to the dark

Some are better than good
And greater than great
Some are misunderstood
They get told to wait
Some are just no good
Some will let it just fade
Some are misunderstood
We'll just have to wait, 'cause

All of the greatest
Greatest of all
Were chasing their fading star
Wanna know who
Who'll be the latest
The latest to fall?
We're marching into the dark
I wanna go marching into the dark
All of the greatest
Greatest of all
Were chasing their fading star
Were chasing their fading star
Who'll be the latest
Latest to fall?
Marching into the dark
