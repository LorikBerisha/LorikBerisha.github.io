Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine,
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs,
Seek it out and ye shall find.

Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I I I I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
And I I I I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing

I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive.

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting stars

Ye-e-yeah

I feel her love
And I feel it burn down this river every time
Hope is our four-letter word, make that money watch it burn

Old but, I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

And I I I I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting stars

Oh, take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn,
Sing in the river the lessons I learned

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be

I stared up at the sun,
Thought of all of the people, places and things I’ve loved.
I stared up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me.

You can feel the light start to tremble,
Washing what you know out to sea.
You can see your life out of the window tonight.

If I lose myself tonight,
It’ll be by your side.
I lose myself tonight...
(oh) yeah, yeah, yeah.

If I lose myself tonight,
It’ll be you and I.
Lose myself tonight...

I woke up with the sun,

You can see your life out of the window tonight.

Take us down and we keep trying,
Forty thousand feet, keep flying.
Take us down and we keep trying,
Forty thousand feet, keep flying.
Take us down and we keep trying,
Forty thousand feet, keep flying.
Take us down and we keep trying,
Forty thousand feet, keep flying.

If I lose myself tonight...

It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I had 'til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool that's been on the run

Heart's still beating but it's not working
It's like a million dollar phone that you just can't ring
I reached out trying to love but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb

But with you
I feel again
Yeah, with you
I can feel again

Yeah

Woo-hoo [x4]

I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me

It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I broke 'til my feet went numb
[Album version:] Praying like a fool just shot the gun
[Radio version:] Praying like a fool just shy of a gun

Heart still beating but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reached out trying to love but I feel nothing
Oh, my heart is numb

But with you
I feel again
Yeah, with you
I can feel again

But with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I feel again
(I was a lonely soul but that's the old me)
Yeah, with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I can feel again
(I was a lonely soul)

Woo-hoo [x5]

(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)

I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
A little wiser now from what you've shown me
Yeah, I feel again
Feel again...

Hope when you take that jump, you don't fear the fall
Hope when the water rises, you built a wall
Hope when the crowd screams out, they're screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs, you choose to stay

Hope that you fall in love, and it hurts so bad
The only way you can know is give it all you have
And I hope that you don't suffer but take the pain
Hope when the moment comes, you'll say...

I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places, the things that I did
With every broken bone, I swear I lived

Hope that you spend your days, but they all add up
And when that sun goes down, hope you raise your cup
Oh, I wish that I could witness all your joy and all your pain
But until my moment comes, I'll say...

I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places, the things that I did

About how we only get one life
Woke me up right after two
Stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn't lose my mind

And I had the week that came from hell
And yes I know that you could tell
But you're like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

And if you only die once I wanna die with
You got something I need
In this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once, (hey)
I wanna die with you (you, you, you)

Honey don't you be afraid

I used to buy and sell gravity
I knew how to fly
And I would teach you for a fee
Broke every window
In my hotel heart
When I was only 5 years old but 12 years scarred
And I'd hear the same voice
Echo in my mind
Said, "Son you got an angel,
To chase the devil at night."
Yeah

When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves."
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

I took a little faith
And put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town
Full of "have" and "have nots"
And as I walked through that storybook life
I was looking for an angel to chase the devil at night
Oh! Oh! Oh!
