Good morning [x4]

Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed
I mean, damn, did you even see the test
You got D's mother fucker, D's, Rosie Perez
And yes, barely pass any and every class
Looking at every ass
Cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie, this shit is basic
Welcome to graduation

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Good morning
On this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like a fly Malcolm X
Buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets of the league
From an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain
Look how far we done came
Haters saying ya changed
Now ya doing ya thing

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Good morning
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future
While I hop in the Delorean
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness
After all of that, you receive this

Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still living
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still living
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still living
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still living
Get on down

Get on down
Get, get on down
Get on down

[chorus:]
(Did you realize
That you were a champion?
In their eyes)
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
That's that shit
So if you're gonna do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize
That you were a champion?
In their eyes)

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But everytime I want it, layaway or a deposit
My dad'll say "When you see clothes close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'cause every summer he'll get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd sent me back to school with a new wardrobe and hey!

[chorus]

When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'cause who the kids gonna listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the Drop Out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

(Did you realize
That you were a champion?
In their eyes)
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?

Work it, make it, do it,
Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger!

[played in background, continuously:]
Work it harder, make it better,
do it faster, makes us stronger,
more than ever, hour after,
Our work is never over.

[Chorus:]
Na-na-na that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on you

I need you right now
I need you right now

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right?
Awesome, the Christian and Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead go nuts go ape shit
Especially in my pastel on my bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homie, take six, and take this, haters

[Chorus]

I need you right now
I need you right now

Me likey

I don't know if you got a man or not,
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me

So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde-dike
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Ugh, baby, you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

[Chorus]

I need you right now
I need you right now

You know how long I've been on you?
Since Prince was on Appolonia
Since OJ had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told you [x6]
Baby, you're making it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

[Chorus]

I need you right now [x4]

You know how long I've been on you?
Since Prince was on Appolonia
Since OJ had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told you
Never told you [x4]

Never over [x8]

Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hot lines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams

I had a dream I can buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.
I told God I'd be back in a second,
Man it's so hard not to act reckless.
To whom much is given much is tested.
Get arrested, guess until, they get the message.
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,
and what I do? Act more stupidly.
bought more jewelry, more Louis V, my momma couldn't get through to me.
The drama, people suing me,
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.
I'm just saying how I feel man,
I ain't one of the Cosby's I ain't go to Hill man
I guess the money should've changed him,
I guess I should've forgot where I came from.

[Chorus:]
La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right
la, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing right
Excuse Me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
(Ha ha) you can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors.
This is my life homey, you decide yours.
I know that Jesus died for us,
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars.
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking about back in my day
But homey this is my day.
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
You know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if magic made it.

They say I talk with so much emphasis,
Oh, they're so sensitive.
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
Say something were you gone end up apologising.
Let me know if it's a problem man,
Alright man, holla then.

[Chorus]

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash,
Let that man get past.
You don't need a stop to get gas,
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of h**s?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.
Treasure. What's you pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.
So if the devil wear Prada,
Adam Eve wear Nada,
I'm in between, but way more fresher.
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard,
That's when you die hard.
Ya homies looking like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my god.

Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam,

now everything I'm not, made me everything I am.
damn, here we go again.
people talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am.

I never be picture-perfect-Beyonce
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

and I'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get their haircut
OK fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reebok's, or Adidas
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the India.Arie award
they'd rather give me the nigga-please award
but I'll just take the I-got-a-lot-of-cheese award

damn, here we go again.
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killing's some wack shit
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
the slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

damn, here we go again.

Uh uh uh

Now where the west side
I can't study war
Yep

Uh

Can I talk my shit again?
Even if I don't hit again
Dog are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat, Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatello Versace,
That's Louis Vuitton bitch
I think Hennessy, I drank I'm gone on that Bacardi Lemon, Corona, I'm zoning
Class back in session so I up't it a grade
Two years the Dwayne Wayne became the Dwyane Wade
And A
Please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the barkers, I'm hood like parkers
While you all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring
You all brides maids catch the garter
On nights when romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy
The hood love to listen to jeezy and weezy and o yeah yeezy
I did it for the glory

[chorus sample]

I can't study war
No no
I can't study war
No no
The glory
I can't study war
No no
I can't study war
I did it for the glory
I can't study war
No no I can't study war
No no I can't study war
I did it for the glory
No no I can't study war
No no I can't study war
The glory
No no
I can't study war
Uh

What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up
How I suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammies I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little gweedo
But with my ego, I can stand there with a speedo
And still be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the Nike the chronic
Empty bottles of no do's
Tank on empty whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logo's
The furrest man that shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that to door cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinned ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what does it feel like
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot
You know BIG and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone big pun big l or notorious
Fit in
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna start killin' these niggas as soon as the chorus hit

[chorus sample]

No no I can't study war
Yeah I'm gonna start killin' these niggas soon as the chorus hit
I can't study war
No no
Uh
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory
No no I can't study war
No no I can't study war
Uh
No no I can't study war
The glory
